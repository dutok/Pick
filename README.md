# Pick
A fast and simple Minecraft server control panel in Go.

**Please note:** This project is still in development and is very buggy. Please use caution if you decide to use this in production and feel free to send pull requests! 

## Install
```
go get github.com/dutok/Pick
```

## Usage
Run:
```
pick
```
to launch the control panel.

The control panel will (currently) only launch from outside a directory named 'server' with the server .jar file named 'minecraft_server.jar'.
